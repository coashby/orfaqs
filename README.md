# ORFaqs: The Open Reading Frame Analysis and Queries Tool for Genomic Sequences
ORFaqs is an open-source library for open reading frame analysis. At its core,
ORFaqs discovers all regions of a DNA or RNA sequence that are contained within
a start/stop codon pair.

With ORFaqs you can:
- **Discover**: Define regions of interest within a genomic sequence and
discover all segments that lie between a defined set of start and stop codons.
- **Query**: Filter results from the discovery stage. For example
- **Model**
